To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/institute-website.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd institute-website
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Note: Since this project utilizes PHP, you'll need to set up a local web server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) to run the PHP components correctly.
